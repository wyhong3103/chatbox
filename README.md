# Thoughts

This is my very first attempt on something related to backend, it was quite fun. Also, planning things beforehand really helped a lot, it gives you a clearer picture on what you're going to do. I wasn't used to planning things in the previous projects, and because of that, I tend to get lost during the middle of a project. There is one thing that I should do in this project, but did not do at all, which is unit testing. Overall I think it is a good one because I learned quite a few things from this project.
